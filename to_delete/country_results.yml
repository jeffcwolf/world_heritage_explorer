  - Cultural
  - "<p>There are around 48 Buddhist monuments in the Horyu-ji area, in Nara Prefecture.
    Several date from the late 7th or early 8th century, making them some of the oldest
    surviving wooden buildings in the world. These masterpieces of wooden architecture
    are important not only for the history of art, since they illustrate the adaptation
    of Chinese Buddhist architecture and layout to Japanese culture, but also for
    the history of religion, since their construction coincided with the introduction
    of Buddhism to Japan from China by way of the Korean peninsula.</p>"

    architecture, comprising 83 buildings with highly developed systems of defence
    and ingenious protection devices dating from the beginning of the Shogun period.
    It is a masterpiece of construction in wood, combining function with aesthetic
    appeal, both in its elegant appearance unified by the white plastered earthen
    walls and in the subtlety of the relationships between the building masses and
    the multiple roof layers.</p>"

    for a long period of time, these villages with their Gassho-style houses subsisted
    on the cultivation of mulberry trees and the rearing of silkworms. The large houses
    with their steeply pitched thatched roofs are the only examples of their kind
    in Japan. Despite economic upheavals, the villages of Ogimachi, Ainokura and Suganuma

    environment and people's social and economic circumstances.</p>"

    in the area where the first atomic bomb exploded on 6 August 1945. Through the
    efforts of many people, including those of the city of Hiroshima, it has been
    preserved in the same state as immediately after the bombing. Not only is it a

    by pilgrimage routes to the ancient capital cities of Nara and Kyoto, reflect
    the fusion of Shinto, rooted in the ancient tradition of nature worship in Japan,
    and Buddhism, which was introduced from China and the Korean Peninsula. The sites
    (495.3 ha) and their surrounding forest landscape reflect a persistent and extraordinarily
    well-documented tradition of sacred mountains over 1,200 years. The area, with
    its abundance of streams, rivers and waterfalls, is still part of the living culture
    of Japan and is much visited for ritual purposes and hiking, with up to 15 million

    example of the interaction of marine and terrestrial ecosystems as well as extraordinary
    ecosystem productivity, largely influenced by the formation of seasonal sea ice
    at the lowest latitude in the northern hemisphere. It has particular importance
    for a number of marine and terrestrial species, some of them endangered and endemic,
    such as Blackiston&rsquo;s fish owl and the Viola kitamiana plant. The site is
    globally important for threatened seabirds and migratory birds, a number of salmonid

    the archaeological remains of large-scale mines, smelting and refining sites and
    mining settlements worked between the 16th and 20th centuries. The site also features
    routes used to transport silver ore to the coast, and port towns from where it
    was shipped to Korea and China. The mines contributed substantially to the overall
    economic development of Japan and south-east Asia in the 16th and 17th centuries,
    prompting the mass production of silver and gold in Japan. The mining area is
    now heavily wooded. Included in the site are fortresses, shrines, parts of Kaid&ocirc;

    people aspire to after death, as well as peace of mind in this life. In combination
    with indigenous Japanese nature worship and Shintoism, Pure Land Buddhism developed
    a concept of planning and garden design that was unique to Japan.</p>"

  - "<p>The beauty of the solitary, often snow-capped, stratovolcano, known around
    the world as Mount Fuji, rising above villages and tree-fringed sea and lakes
    has long been the object of pilgrimages and inspired artists and poets. The inscribed
    property consists of 25 sites which reflect the essence of Fujisan&rsquo;s sacred
    and artistic&nbsp;landscape. In the 12th&nbsp;century, Fujisan became the centre
    of training for ascetic Buddhism, which included Shinto elements. On the upper
    1,500-metre tier of the 3,776m mountain, pilgrim routes and crater shrines have
    been inscribed alongside sites around the base of the mountain including Sengen-jinja
    shrines, Oshi lodging houses, and natural volcanic features such as lava tree
    moulds, lakes, springs and waterfalls, which are revered as sacred. Its representation
    in Japanese art goes back to the 11th&nbsp;century, but 19th&nbsp;century woodblock
    prints of views, including those from sand beaches with pine tree groves have

  - "<p>This property is a historic sericulture and silk mill complex established
    in the late 19th and early 20th century in the Gunma prefecture, north-west of
    Tokyo. It consists of four sites that correspond to the different stages in the
    production of raw silk: a large raw silk reeling plant whose machinery and industrial
    expertise were imported from France; an experimental farm for production of cocoons;
    a school for the dissemination of sericulture knowledge; and a cold-storage facility
    for silkworm eggs. The site illustrates Japan’s desire to rapidly access the best
    mass production techniques, and became a decisive element in the renewal of sericulture
    and the Japanese silk industry in the last quarter of the 19th century. Tomioka
    Silk Mill and its related sites became the centre of innovation for the production
    of raw silk and marked Japan’s entry into the modern, industrialized era, making
    it the world’s leading exporter of raw silk, notably to Europe and the United
    States.</p>"
